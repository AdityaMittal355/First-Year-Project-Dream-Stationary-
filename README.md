# Website
Dreamstationary test website
 
To access the website you will need the xampp software installed on your machine.
Once installed put the website named folder in xampp/htdocs.
Now run xampp and start Apache and MySQL.
Now go to your browser and type http://localhost/website.
I have implemented backend login system but it may not work as the database is stored on my local system but I think the front part should be visible.
